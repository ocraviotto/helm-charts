# Readeck Helm Chart
{{ template "chart.deprecationWarning" . }}

{{ template "chart.badgesSection" . }}

This is a Helm chart for [readeck](https://readeck.org), a tool to keep all that web content youâ€™ll want to revisit in an hour, tomorrow, or in 20 years.

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a Readeck deployment on a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm package manager.
The chart itself has no dependencies, as Readeck can run with SQLite (which requires persistence), but it supports configuring a separate PostgreSQL database for better scalability.
Though the chart takes care of multiple aspects of Readeck's configuration, make sure to read the [documentation](https://readeck.org/en/docs/),
in particular in relation to the [configuration](https://readeck.org/en/docs/configuration).

## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.23+
* Helm 3.8.0+

### Additionally

If enabling persistence with claim enabled:

* PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `readeck`:

```bash
helm install readeck oci://ghcr.io/ocraviotto/charts/readeck --version {{ template "chart.version" . }}
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `readeck` release:

```bash
helm delete readeck
```

## Example

The [external-resources example](examples/external-resources) contains a modified values file to use with a more production-like environment.
Make sure to check it out if intending on a more serious use of Readeck.
